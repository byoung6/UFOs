#### UFOs

1. Overview

The purpose of this project is to refactor existing code to create a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The filter is improved from the existing date only search criteria, to allow for city, state, country, and shape of the UFO sighting.

2. Results

The current version of the website allows for searches via the search function on the left column. ![search bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76926631/147419358-6193942b-9a6b-4e8f-b18f-c3c053ae9f25.PNG)

Using this search bar, we can narrow down the search parameters such as using "el cajon" and "ca" for the city and state fields.

3. Summary

The web application is not complete, as there are many things that can be done to improve functinality. The drawback of the search criteria is that it does not control for content formatting such as capitalization. Additionnaly, in order to refresh the main table, a user would need to refresh the entire page in order to see the entire table. Futher development of the application can include a table refresh function, once the search parameter has been cleared.
